# Homework Submission Guide

This guide outlines the requirements and best practices for submitting CAGD homework assignments.

## Required Files for Submission

Every homework submission must include the following files in a single zip archive:

### 1. Main Code Files
- **`hw{N}.py`** - Main implementation file (e.g., `hw1.py`, `hw2.py`)
- **`test_hw{N}.py`** - Comprehensive test suite using pytest

### 2. Documentation
- **`report.md`** - Detailed project report including:
  - Implementation overview
  - Method descriptions and mathematical background
  - Analysis of results and trade-offs
  - Answers to specific questions (if any)
- **`README.md`** - Usage instructions and setup guide

### 3. Dependency Management
- **`pyproject.toml`** - Modern Python dependency specification
- **`uv.lock`** - Exact dependency versions (generated by uv)
- **`.python-version`** - Python version specification

### 4. Assignment Materials
- **`cagd-homework-{N}.pdf`** - Original assignment PDF

## Zip File Naming Convention

Use the following naming format for your zip file:
```
{StudentID}-{Name}-hw{N}.zip
```

**Examples:**
- `84-谌奕同-hw1.zip`
- `123-JohnDoe-hw2.zip`

## File Structure Inside Zip

Your zip should contain files directly (not in a subfolder), like this:

```
84-谌奕同-hw1.zip
├── hw1.py
├── test_hw1.py
├── report.md
├── README.md
├── pyproject.toml
├── uv.lock
├── .python-version
└── cagd-homework-1.pdf
```

## Setup Instructions for TAs

Include clear instructions in your README.md so TAs can run your code:

### Environment Setup
```bash
# Install uv (if not already installed)
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Set up the project
uv sync

# Run the main program
uv run hw1.py

# Run tests
uv run pytest
```

### Dependencies
Your `pyproject.toml` should include:
- Core dependencies (numpy, matplotlib, scipy)
- Testing framework (pytest)
- Any GUI libraries needed (pyqt5 for interactive plotting)

## Code Quality Requirements

### Testing
- Comprehensive test coverage including edge cases
- Stress tests for large inputs and extreme values
- All tests must pass: `uv run pytest`

### Documentation
- Clear code comments
- Mathematical explanations in report
- Usage examples in README

### Error Handling
- Robust handling of edge cases (empty data, duplicates, etc.)
- Graceful degradation when methods fail
- No crashes on invalid inputs

## Common Issues to Avoid

1. **Missing Dependencies**: Always include `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock`
2. **Hardcoded Paths**: Use relative paths or environment variables
3. **Platform Dependencies**: Ensure cross-platform compatibility
4. **Large Files**: Don't include virtual environments or cache files
5. **Incomplete Testing**: Include comprehensive tests that validate all functionality

## Verification Checklist

Before submitting, verify:

- [ ] All code runs without errors: `uv run python hw{N}.py`
- [ ] All tests pass: `uv run pytest`
- [ ] Report answers all assignment questions
- [ ] README provides clear setup and usage instructions
- [ ] Zip contains all required files with correct naming
- [ ] No unnecessary files (no .git/, .venv/, __pycache__/, etc.)

## Example Submission Structure

For a complete homework submission:

```
📦 84-谌奕同-hw1.zip
├── 📄 hw1.py (main interactive curve fitting code)
├── 📄 test_hw1.py (21 comprehensive tests)
├── 📄 report.md (detailed analysis and answers)
├── 📄 README.md (setup and usage guide)
├── 📄 pyproject.toml (dependencies)
├── 📄 uv.lock (locked versions)
├── 📄 .python-version (Python 3.12)
└── 📄 cagd-homework-1.pdf (assignment)
```

This structure ensures TAs can quickly set up and evaluate your work without compatibility issues.</content>
